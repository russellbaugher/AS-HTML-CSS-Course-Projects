			<p>Northern Thailand is a place of majestic beauty and diversity that is perfect for both adventure and relaxation. It can be a refreshing retreat from the hustle and bustle of city life. Visitors have a chance to experience a wide range of nature-oriented activities when in this amazing area of Thailand. My experience with this region is based out of Phu Chaisai Mountain Resort, in the Chang Rai Province and the available sightseeing and adventure activities surrounding its lush, natural property.</p>
