        <img src="assets/pattayasunset.jpg" alt="Nongprue" width="300px">
        <p>Although primarily known as an international tourist destination, with its local population catering to tourism in it's city center, Nongprue retains some key Thai cultural aspects throughout. Inside the tourism zone, traditional street foods are available for locals and foreigners alike. In the center of the city, various renditions of popular songs of the West can be heard as well as pop Thai music. Outside of the center of town, life begins to normalize with traditional foods and music. </p>
